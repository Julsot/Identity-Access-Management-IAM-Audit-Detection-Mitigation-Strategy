# Identity-Access-Management-IAM-Audit-Detection-Mitigation-Strategy
Project Overview: > This project documents a comprehensive security audit of modern identity flows within a global-scale streaming platform. The focus was to analyze the practical implementation of OIDC/OAuth 2.0 protocols, session management via Cookies and Bearer Tokens, and the design of detection strategies for session hijacking.

Key Areas Analyzed:

Token Lifecycle: Identification of Opaque vs. JWT structures.

Security Headers: Audit of Authorization: Bearer and Cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure).

Anomaly Detection: Implementation logic for Impossible Travel alerts based on Context-Aware Access.
